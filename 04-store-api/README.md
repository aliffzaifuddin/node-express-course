# In this project, we learn 

- To filter data solely from the back end
- To add filter based on the criteria taken from the data object namely name, price, rating, featured and so on
- We can create pagination by applying to the data the properties of page, limit and skip
- We can use numeric filters to filter by value of prices and ratings of the sample data

All the files and starter codes are owned by John Smilga and FreeCodeCamp and edited by me for the learning of Nodejs, Express and this project

## Takeaway learning from this project,
- Learn to use MongoDB for the database and link with the app
- Learn Mongoose to setup a schema for the data model types classification
- Learn to use Express router to route all the API 
- Use .env to store secret data and not to expose to public
- Create custom errors to display when encounter errors 
- Learn to use async wrappper to manually wrap async function (next time will be using built in package express-async-errors)
