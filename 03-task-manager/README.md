# In this project, we learn that

- to setup and connect to cloud database
- to perform CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on our data
- this is only back end project, all front end already had been prepared

All the files and starter codes are owned by John Smilga and FreeCodeCamp and edited by me for the learning of Nodejs, Express and this project

Takeaway learning from this project,
- Learn to use MongoDB for the database and link with the app
- Learn Mongoose to setup a schema for the data model types classification
- Learn to use Express router to route all the API 
- Use .env to store secret data and not to expose to public
- Create custom errors to display when encounter errors 
- Learn to use async wrappper to manually wrap async function (next time will be using built in package express-async-errors)
